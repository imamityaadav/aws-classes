1. create a lambda function to auto tag resources (refer 8-nov class)

2. create a vpc using cloudformation template

3. create a autoscaling group (launch template) use ubuntu server AMI

4. auto scaling group will create a server if u give desired as 1

5. create a ec2 user to login using password instead key pair

6. create SNS topic and add your email id for alerts and suscribe the notifications 

7. configure cloudwatch to the server created above for cpu utilisation and status check failure (set up alarms) -- this will send alarms to given mail id

8. dowland stress package in ec2 and apply as we did in our auto scaling class.

9. after completing all the above steps -- you should get alerts on given mail id as the cpu stress is high and auto scaling group should create a new instance 
check the instance have the same user u created in first server.
